To maintain a professional appearance at all times not only helps you retain your current customer base, but also helps to attract new, prospective clients. Requiring all employees to bathe daily, as well as come to work in a clean, neat and tidy uniform is crucial. Professional employees, who smell fresh, and maintain a crisp, clean appearance go a long way in creating a competent aura.<\/p>",

You should wash your hands with hot water and one of our hand soaps like a Stoko solvent-free hand soap. Thoroughly scrub your hands for 20 seconds, making sure to cover all parts of your hands, including under fingernails, around cuticles, and in between fingers. After scrubbing, hold your hands under running water to rinse leftover lather. Then, dry off hands with a paper towel or hand dryer. This is important because leaving hands soapy or wet can contribute to dermatitis. If you used a paper towel, hold onto it after drying to turn off the faucet and pull open the door. This will prevent your fingers from picking up germs on the faucet and door handle.<\/p><p>Another way to curtail the spread of germs is to supply employees with their own personal bottle of hand sanitizer like bottle of Deb InstantFOAMÂ® Complete Hand Sanitizer. This way they can frequently sanitize their hands throughout the day without the need of a sink.<\/p>",
