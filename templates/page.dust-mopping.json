For example, retail and grocery store aisles are typically 6 to 7 feet wide, so a 36\" dust mop would be perfect for this situation, because you can clean nearly half the aisle in one pass, yet still allow customers to pass by as you clean. Larger areas, like warehouse aisles would need something larger like a 60\" warehouse dust mop.<\/p>",

Pull the mop head back frequently and shake out or drop against the ground to keep the dust\/debris in front of the mop and not from loading up in the strands of the mop. When you reach the end of the aisle, make a large sweeping turn, keeping the debris in front of the mop and go back down the aisle overlapping the last path by about 6 or 8 inches. When dust mopping smaller areas, such as bathrooms or offices, use a smaller mop like our 24\" microfiber dust mop. Start dust mopping at the doorway and work the outer perimeter, pushing everything to the center of the room for later removal with a mop and dust pan.<\/p>",
