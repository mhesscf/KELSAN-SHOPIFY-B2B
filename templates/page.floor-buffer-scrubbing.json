Using too much solution can leave residue on the floor and make it look worse than when you started. Tilt the buffer back and place the necessary floor scrubbing pad on the pad driver. (Red for everyday scrubbing, Blue for medium duty scrubbing, and Green for heavy duty scrubbing). You can also use floor scrubbing brushes instead of pads. This will depend on the surface that needs scrubbing.

Some people prefer to sling the power cord over one shoulder to assist in moving the cord as you scrub. Place the handle of the buffer into your belt line. Use both your hands to pull down on the safety lever and start the machine. Do not fight with the buffer, as it is a powerful machine and will win every time. Instead learn to flow with the machine. A simple down pressure on the handle will cause the machine to scrub to the left. Once the machine comes to about a 45° angle from where you started, lift slightly up on the handle and the machine will scrub to the right. Repeat these steps as you slowly start to move forward, all the while pulling the handle on the solution tank to dispense solution as you go. The video below shows not only the difference between a high speed burnisher and a low speed floor buffer, but it nicely demonstrates the use of both types of machines.<\/p><p>Pads can be used on both sides and need to be changed often so they don't become oversaturated with dirt and debris. Do not run the more aggressive pads dry, or they could do serious damage to your floor or even your machine.<\/p><p>Since the head of the buffer is circular, it will not be able to get into corners of rooms, so a handheld scrub pad like our medium duty blue Octopus scrub pad is recommended for touching up those areas. Be extremely careful when approaching baseboards, furniture, and other fixed objects.<\/p>",
