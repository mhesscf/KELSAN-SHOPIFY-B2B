As you start to scrub, your first pass will be up tight against the wall or on the outer boundary of your scrubbing area. As you reach the end of your first pass and turn to come back, you'll want to make a wide sweeping turn. This will allow the squeegee assembly to recover all of the solution the auto scrubber put down. You will not want to go to the other boundary, instead you'll cut the room in half and go down the middle of the floor. As you continue to scrub, the 2nd pass you make will be just inside the 1st pass, and when you come back, you'll go just outside the return pass that cut the room in half. This will keep you continuously scrubbing and there will be no wasted movement in having to go back over different areas to pick up the solution the squeegee missed. For heavily soiled floors, you may want to do a double scrub. To accomplish this, you'll leave the squeegee in the up position and not even turn on the vacuum motor. You do at least one pass over the entire floor with just scrubbing. You can then come back with the squeegee down and the vacuum motors on, recovering the solution while you scrub again for the 2nd time. There may be some areas that cannot be scrubbed during these procedures, so you can touch those areas up with a mop and bucket, or a handheld scrub pad like our <a href=\"\/products\/medium-duty-blue-octopus-scrub-pads\" title=\"\/products\/medium-duty-blue-octopus-scrub-pads\">medium duty blue handheld scrub pad<\/a>.<\/p>",

If soap and water sits in the solution tank for any amount of time, it can start to congeal and clog solution lines. Rinse out solution tank as thoroughly as possible.
