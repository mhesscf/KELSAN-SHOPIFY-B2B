You'll want to angle your squeegee so only about 1 inch or so of the squeegee is touching the window. With some force, drag the squeegee down creating a 1 inch barrier from the window frame and the area to be squeegeed. Wipe off your squeegee blade with a towel. Starting in the upper left corner, pull your squeegee straight across at about a 45° angle. As you hit the right frame of the window, slowly start to turn the angle at which you squeegee is on the glass to start an \"S\" like motion to come back with. You will continue to use this motion until you reach the bottom of the window and can run your squeegee across the bottom of the frame, cleaning the last of the window.<\/p><p>While you are doing these steps, it is a good idea to use consistent pressure, and to always have 95% of your squeegee on a wet surface. This will make the squeegee blades last longer. Also, you never want to have the squeegee blade leave the window during cleaning, as this can create a line, and you'll have to start all over if you want perfectly spotless windows.<\/p>",

Start cleaning by spraying the deionized water into the corners of the window frame, and rinsing the window from the top down. Using a \"Z\" motion, continue to rinse the window until you reach the bottom of the frame. Scrub the window thoroughly, and then rinse once more. Because you're using pure water, the window can then dry and will be perfectly clean (because the deionized water is pure and holds no impurities to stick to the window).<\/p>",
